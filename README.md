Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction of customer churn

We prepare our intial dataset of 10,000 customers for exploratory data analysis by checking columns and deciding if they are needed or can be dropped. After that we perform the exploratory analysis using visualization tools. We gather useful insights from the graphs. We have to prepare the dataset for the training the prediction models. We use iteration to determine the best intial setting for each model. After that we fit the best variations of each model and review their accuracy. In this analysis we compare two types of logistic regression, two types of support vector machines and random forrest classifier.
